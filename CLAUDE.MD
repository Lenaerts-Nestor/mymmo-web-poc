## issue

the thing is when i navigate between page , lets say the user goes to conversation and then decide to go back to zones, the zones reload and same happends when i go inbox.

and also another issue i have is that it seems that its also getting again all the unread zones and so on zone page every time i navigate to it. so when navigating i have to wait to see all the unread zones.

the user experience isnt so good as i want. i would like to know how to solve these issues. thanks in advance.

maybe we can remove the inbox page temporary in general and the on the sidebar too .
